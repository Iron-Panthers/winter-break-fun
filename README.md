### Instructions
There are several assignments in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NLcqq41JP_fEn9IeM-8WH5F5AcdkmE5eqUX8m_-3nhY/edit?usp=sharing)\
Follow along with the lessons and instructions there in order to learn more about Java!
### Setup
Clone this repo and branch off of main
Navigate down to ```\lib\src\main\java\winterbreakstudying````
Then, run a build (next section)

### Test\Build!
Once you've determined which assigments you'd like to do, go write up some code in the corresponding files.
You can then run a gradle test to see if your solutions are correct!
<br/><br/>
In order to run a test you have multiple options.
You could either run this set of commands:

```{ctrl} + {shift} + p ```\
```WPILib: Build Robot Code```\
```java```

or (the faster way) ```{ctrl} + {shift} + b + b```

### Spotless Errors?!
Make sure to save your files with ```{ctrl} + s```\
I've configured it so that spotless will automatically format your files when you save, so it'll make your code look pretty.
<br/><br/>
If you hate me, then you can also use ```./gradlew spotlessApply``` in the terminal to format all files at once
